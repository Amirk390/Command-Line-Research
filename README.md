# Command-Line-Research

## Results
1. Research how to:
  + customise your command line to make it pretty and useful (ie. git branch/branch status parser)
  + install using a package manager
2. Create a "workshop", designed to walk the rest of your cohort through the steps (this doesn't need to be long - just one markdown file)
